// Standalone entry point for the daily database keepalive. Run by the "Keep Database Awake"
// GitHub Action (and usable locally via `npm run keepalive`).
//
// Why this exists: MongoDB Atlas pauses a free cluster after 30 days without a connection, and
// a paused cluster refuses ALL connections until a human clicks Resume in the dashboard - it
// does not wake itself when traffic arrives. Left alone over a long break with no visitors, the
// database would pause and every API route would start returning 500 while the static site kept
// loading normally. One connection a day makes the 30-day counter unreachable.
//
// It deliberately goes through the public HTTP endpoint rather than connecting with the driver:
//   - GET /api/projects already reads MongoDB, so serving it resets Atlas's idle timer.
//   - No database credential has to be stored in this public repo's Actions secrets.
//   - It exercises the whole path (Vercel function -> Atlas), so it doubles as an uptime check.
//     A direct driver connection would prove only that Atlas itself is reachable.
